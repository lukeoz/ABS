# ABS

This module uses the pandasdmx package to retrieve data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics using the ABS.Stat Developer API.

The module requires a Query URL as an input argument, which specfies the data to be retrieved from ABS.Stat.

This URL can be generated from this page on the ABS website: http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/sdmx-json/

More information about the API can be found at  https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1407.0.55.002~User%20Guide~Main%20Features~ABS.Stat%20Developer%20API%20(JSON)~3
